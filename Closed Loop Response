The response of DC motor was then calculated by Ziegler-Nichols method. We selected the following set of points (洧노a, 洧녽a) and (洧노b, 洧녽b). The first point corresponds to output of step response at a value of 35.3% and the second point corresponds to output of step response at a value of 85.3%. By using this method, we got open loop step response values of DC motor given as follows: 
洧노a = 8 sec, 洧녽a = 14.52
洧노b = 37.7 sec, 洧녽b = 35.09 
and dc gain 洧띻 = 41.1449
Using Ziegler-Nichols rules we derived PID controller parameters.

Kp = 0.8000
Ki = 0.6380
Kd = 0.2508

By using the above values of K洧녷, K洧녰, and K洧녬, PID controller was designed. PID controller was tuned  keeping the objective that settling time ts and rise time tr should be minimum.
